# word-guess-game

Guess the Pokemon Character Name.
Use Key events to listen for the letters that the player will type.
Press any key to get started!


For example,
If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _  _ a.


The Screen will display the following:
Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).
After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
